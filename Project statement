I'm excited to announce my latest project: a comprehensive compilation of OSINT tools. This project aims to bring together a variety of tools that can assist in the collection, analysis, and reporting of open-source intelligence. Each tool in the compilation will be documented with detailed instructions on its usage, capabilities, and best practices.

The goal is to create a one-stop repository for OSINT practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts to easily access and utilize these tools for their investigative needs. This repository will be continually updated with new tools and resources to ensure it remains a valuable asset for the community.

Stay tuned for the launch of this new repository, and join me in exploring the vast potential of open-source intelligence!
